implemented aimbot functions for yuna api
added some new common functions (run_each_frame, wait_frames, controllerdata, get_status_string, is_friend).
fixed aimbot leads being marked as "nil Lead"

- added lua file manager in settings tab
  - to have your lua scripts show up in the lua manager then add your .lua file to Yuna\Football Fusion 2\API Scripts
  - i have to simplify this for slow people eventually :pensive:

code example on how to make a auto fade:
```lua
  aimbot.register_mode("Fade", 0) -- Mode Name, Lead

  common.run_each_frame(function()
      if aimbot.get_mode() == "Fade" then
          aimbot.set_angle(75)
      else
          -- restore the old angle, too lazy to in this code snippet
      end
  end)
```
